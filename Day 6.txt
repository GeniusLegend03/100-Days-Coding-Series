Day 6 coding Statement:  Write a program to find the Quadrants in which coordinates lie
Get the value of x and y coordinates as input from the user and check in which quadrant the point lies and print it.

Input
10 20

Output
This point lies in first quadrant.

Input
-10 20

Output
This point lies in second quadrant.
